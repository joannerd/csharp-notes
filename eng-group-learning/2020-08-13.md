## 1. What is an interface and its purpose?

An interface is a _contract_ ensuring the input/output typing of an entity's
properties and methods. It can be used as a sort of _wrapper_ type. An entity's
properties and methods are known as _signature lines_. An interface includes the
_minimum_ signature lines of a model. A model using the interface can have
additional signature lines, but must have the minimum signature lines listed in
the interface. Each signature line defines an output type and input type.

**Shortcut: generate interface with `cmd` + `.` + `Extract interface`**

Parent classes inheritance must preface interface assignment.

```c#
public class PhysicalProductModel : PhysicalProductBase, IProductModel
```

Although a class can only inherit from one parent class, it can implement
multiple interfaces because interfaces are simply _contracts_.

```c#
public class DigitalProductModel : IProductModel, IDigitalProductModel
```

Alternatively, an interface can build on top of another interface.

```c#
public interface IDigitalProductModel : IProductModel
```

The `DigitalProductModel` below will have all the signature lines of both the
`IDigitalProductModel` and the `IProductModel`.

```c#
public class DigitalProductModel : IDigitalProductModelIDigitalProductModel
```

> **Side note**: the `digital` variable below is set to the `prod` object if
> `prod is IDigitalProductModel`.

```c#
if (prod is IDigitalProductModel digital)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"For the { digital.Title } you have { digital.TotalDownloadsLeft } downloads left");
}
```

## 2. What is an abstract class and what is it used for?


## 3. Find an example of an interface in Titan.
### How it works
### Why we used it in that specific scenario

## 4. Find an example in Titan of where we might want to implement an interface.
### Why would an interface be beneficial in that scenario?
### Bonus: implement that interface.

## 5. What's the Interface Segregation Principle?
### Is there an example of that principle in practice in Titan?
