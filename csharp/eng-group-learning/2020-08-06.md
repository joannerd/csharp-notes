## 1. Working with Classes and Objects

Compare and contrast C# and Ruby when it comes to methods, fields, and
constructors.

```rb
class Book
  def initialize(name)
    @grades = []
    @name = name
  end

  def add_grade(grade)
    @grades.push(grade)
  end
end
```

```c#
class Book
{
  public Book(string name)
  {
    grades = new List<double>();
    this.name = name;
  }

  public void AddGrade(double grade)
  {
    grades.Add(grade);
  }

  // Field definition (local state):
  // - can't use implicit typing (var)
  public List<double> grades;
  private string name;

  // List<double> grades = new List<double>();
  // ^ alternative to setting variable in constructor
}
```

|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `Book.new()`           | `new Book()`                          |
| `def initialize(name)` | `public Book(string name)`            |
| `self`                 | `this`                                |
| protected variables    | private variables                     |
| attribute readers      | access modifiers                      |
| instance variable      | field definition                      |
| instance method        | `public` (for instance member access) |
| class method           | `static` (for object reference)       | 

## 2. Does C# pass parameters by reference or by value?

By default, C# always passes parameters by value. In the example below, the
value of `book1` is copied and set as an argument for `SetName`

```c#
var book1 = GetBook("Book 1");
SetName(book1, "New Name");
```

Although it's uncommon, C# can also pass parameters by reference by using the
`ref` keyword (or the `out` keyword if an incoming parameter has not been
initialized).

> **Note**: When you pass a parameter by reference and the referenced argument
> changes, any changes made in the argument are reflected. Using a `ref` for
> this reason is typically very frowned upon. Even in C#. This is referred to as
> a "side effect" of a function.

> Passing in a variable and having it changed out from under you without you
> knowing about it leads to weird bugs that take forever to figure out. This is
> where functional programming paradigms shine: many languages are starting to
> introduce functional concepts directly into their syntax or libraries (i.e.
> Immutable.js, Redux, stateless React components).

**Parameter passed by value (default)**

```c#
public void CSharpIsPassByValue()
{
    var book1 = GetBook("Book 1");
    GetBookSetName(book1, "New Name");
    // `book1` references `GetBook("Book 1")`
    Assert.Equal("Book 1", book1.Name);
}

private void GetBookSetName(Book book, string name)
{
    book = new Book(name);
    book.Name = name;
}
```

**Parameter passed by reference (`ref`)**

```c#
public void CSharpIsPassByRef()
{
    var book1 = GetBook("Book 1");
    GetBookSetNameByRef(ref book1, "New Name");
    
    Assert.Equal("New Name", book1.Name);
}

private void GetBookSetNameByRef(ref Book book, string name)
{
    book = new Book(name);
    book.Name = name;
}
```

**Parameter passed by reference (`out`)**

```c#
public void CSharpIsPassByOutRef()
{
    var book1 = GetBook("Book 1");
    GetBookSetNameByOutRef(out book1, "New Name");
    
    Assert.Equal("New Name", book1.Name);
}

private void GetBookSetNameByOutRef(out Book book, string name)
{
    book = new Book(name);
    book.Name = name;
}
```

Strings, however, are reference type variables (and are passed by reference) -
this is why they are immutable.

```c#
public void StringsBehaveLikeValueTypes()
{
    string name = "Korra";
    MakeReferenceUppercase(name);
    var upper = MakeUppercase(name);

    Assert.Equal("Korra", name);
    Assert.Equal("KORRA", upper);
}

private void MakeReferenceUppercase(string parameter)
{
    parameter.ToUpper();
}

private string MakeUppercase(string parameter)
{
    return parameter.ToUpper();
}
```

| Reference Type                   | Value Type                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `var b = new Book()`             | `var x = 3`                |
| pointer to book object is copied | stored `3` value is copied |

## 3. What is a property? What are they used for?

It's used to encapsulate data, similarly to a field. They have syntax similar to
fields, but more advantageous features. An example of an advantageous feature is
the ability to set the privacy of getters and setters.

```c#
// Public field
public string Name;

// Property member syntax (longhand)
private string name;
public string Name
{
    get
    {
        return name.ToUpper();
    }
    set
    {
        if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
        {
            name = value; // implicit variable `value` available in all setters
        }
    }
}

// Auto property (shorthand)
public string Name { get; set; }
```

> The shorthand syntax will _literally_ generate code that looks something like
this:
>
> ```c#
> private string _name;
> public string Name 
> {
>     get { return _name; }
>     set { _name = value; }
> }
> ```
>
> Back in the day _all_ the methods had to be written like that. A lot of the
> time this is where languages get the stigma of "it's so verbose to write code
> in." Luckily, C# realized it was super verbose and gave us the shorthand
> syntax.

## 4. What is a Member? What is it used for?

A [member] is used to represent the "data and behavior" of a class. All members
(except constructors) are inherited in child classes (aka "derived classes").

Some examples of members are:
- instances of a class (instance members)
- instance variables ([field] members)
- instance methods/constructors/destructors
- properties/attributes
- constants
- events
- nested types (more at [Stack Overflow 1] and [Stack Overflow 2])

Convention: public members (variables) are uppercase (i.e. `Name` instead of
`this.name`).

([Additional resource].)

## 5. What are Events and Delegates? What are they used for?

A delegate is not a method. It functions as a form of typing for methods - it
describes what a method's input/output types look like. A delegate definition is
different from class/struct definition although it looks similar. A delegate can
be initialized in two ways: longhand (`log = new
WriteLogDelegate(ReturnMessage)`) or shorthand (`log = ReturnMessage;`). When a
delegate is initialized, it references a method (`ReturnMessage` in this case).

**Delegate definition**

```c#
public delegate string WriteLogDelegate(string logMessage);
                // ^ describe what a method looks like and name of the delegate
                // ^ method output type   ^ method input type
```

**Delegate initialization**

```c#
public class TypeTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void WriteLogDelegateCanPointToMethod()
    {
        WriteLogDelegate log;

        // New `WriteLogDelegate` is initialized and references `ReturnMessage` method
        // log = new WriteLogDelegate(ReturnMessage);   // Longhand
        log = ReturnMessage;                            // Shorthand

        var result = log("Hello");
        Assert.Equal("Hello!", result);
    }

    // Only has to match return type and parameter type of delegate
    string ReturnMessage(string message)
    {
        return message;
    }
}
```

**Multicast delegate initialization**

```c#
int count = 0;

string ReturnMessage(string message)
{
    count++;
    return message;
}

string IncrementCount(string message)
{
    count++;
    return message;
}

[Fact]
public void WriteLogDelegateCanPointToMethodWithMulticast()
{
    count = 0;
    WriteLogDelegate log = ReturnMessage;
    log += ReturnMessage; // Confused about this and the line above
    log += IncrementCount;

    var result = log("Hello!");
    Assert.Equal("Hello!", result);
    Assert.Equal(3, count);
}
```

The `event` keyword when used in the setting of a delegate variable
(`GradeAdded`) sets an `event` member to the class. An `event` member of a class
can be used to set some sort of event listener in a method, that can later be
handled in an external event handler.

Steps to use events:
1. Define a `delegate` that takes in an event sender (generic `object` type) and
  event arguments (`EventArgs` type)
    ```c#
    public delegate void GradeAddedDelegate(object sender, EventArgs args);
    ```
2. Set the delegate as a named `event`
    ```c#
    public event GradeAddedDelegate GradeAdded;
    ```
3. Raise the event (invoke the delegate)
    ```c#
    GradeAdded(this, new EventArgs());
    ```
4. Define an event handler
    ```c#
    static void OnGradeAdded(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("A grade was added");
    }
    ```
5. Handle the event (use the `+=` or `-=` operator to add/subtract methods
   into/from the "invocation list")
    ```c#
    book.GradeAdded += OnGradeAdded;
    ```

**Set the delegate and event**

```c#
public delegate void GradeAddedDelegate(object sender, EventArgs args);
    
public class Book
{
    public Book(string name)
    {
        grades = new List<double>();
        Name = name;
    }
    public void AddGrade(double grade)
    {
        if (grade <= 100 && grade >= 0)
        {
            grades.Add(grade);
            if (GradeAdded != null)
            {
                // "Raising the event" = invoking the delegate
                // `this` = I am the sender
                GradeAdded(this, new EventArgs());
            }
        }
        else
        {
            throw new ArgumentException($"Invalid {nameof(grade)}");
        }
    }

    public event GradeAddedDelegate GradeAdded;
}
```

**Handle the event**

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // String `name` is "stored and encapsulated" in `Book` class
    var book = new Book("Jo's grade book");

    // Handle GradeAdd event:
    book.GradeAdded += OnGradeAdded;

    // CODE SHORTENED FOR BREVITY
}

static void OnGradeAdded(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("A grade was added");
    }
```
